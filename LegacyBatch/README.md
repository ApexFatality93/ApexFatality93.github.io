# No Man's Sky - My wiki creating script!! v8 updated for new NEXT Hub templates!

Well, today is a big day for the No Man's Sky Galactic Hub reddit community.  Our fearless leader 7101134 and the Hub council has decided on moving to a new location after the 1.30 updates due to system names not reflecting what they are and just starting a new.

Prior to the move, a Hub Council was created to help offload some of the tasks needed to move a virtual civilization of interlopers.  After my script contributions to the community, I was invited into the council and gladly took up a position as a Lead Archivist due to my work on the wiki and making a script to make entry creation easy to add to the Gamepedia No Man's Sky Wiki

So today I announce my updated script version 7.  This template is a basic dos/commandline script that uses input variables to ask questions and then outputs a notepad sourcetext file that you can copy and paste into a new gamepedia.com entry and have a nearly finished wiki entry.

The outputted sourcetext still will need to be edited to add images and other details however this will take out a lot of the work of trying to find and replace fields from an already existing entry.  Notes have been made in the template to help users know what to put where. :)

Templates included:

    Star System
    Planet
    Base
    Ship
    Fauna



Example of gamepedia outputs found here:

    Star System page
    Planet page
    Base page
    Ship page
    Fauna page


# NOTES: 

-some escapable characters may cause funkiness in formatting, the pipe command def does cause issues but i think i've fixed this in v4.0
-once variables are entered, notepad is called to open the text file that gets saved to your desktop. you should be able to then create a new gamepedia wiki page and just insert this code to have a very quick initial wiki page.  
-you will want to edit the tables for resources, planets/moons and blueprints
-images still need to be uploaded and inserted into where i've noted they should go
-text file are created on your desktop and then opened in notepad once created
