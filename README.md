# No Man's Sky - Wiki page creation script!

[![badge](https://badgen.net/badge/Contribute/now!/green?icon=visualstudio)](https://vscode.dev/github/Lenni009/NMSWikiPageCreator)

This is a website intended for making wiki page creation in the [No Man's Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com) easier.

It was originally forked from seamonkey420 who made this in 2017 as a batch script.

To make it more cross platform, with console gamers and other operating systems in mind, it has been ported to the web as a basic webpage.

The webpage was created by [Lenni](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/User:Lenni009) in the name of the [Galactic Hub Eissentam Scribes](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Eissentam_Scribes), but it's free to use for all players of all Hub branches.

It's also open for other civs/companies/players to contribute and add their own version in a subfolder. To do so, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), [fork the repo](https://github.com/Lenni009/Lenni009.github.io/fork), edit to your liking and create a pull request when done or create your own GitHub page from it with GitHub pages ([it's super easy to set up](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)).
